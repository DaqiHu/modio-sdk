# Getting Started

## mod.io Linux SDK Integration

The use of Linux with the mod.io SDK is ready by default. You can find the `linux` directory in the platform subdirectory of your SDK installation.
You can then target `LINUX` to compile the mod.io SDK for Linux SDK.

## Linux SDK Versions

The mod.io SDK is built and tested against Ubuntu 21.04 using clang v10. Using different versions of the Linux SDK may result in compilation issues.

In Linux, the default way to compile the mod.io SDK requires CMake with Ninja as generator, which you can install CMake Installation instructions or using a package manager like `apt`:

```cmake
sudo apt install cmake ninja
```
