# Getting Started

The use of Windows with the mod.io SDK is ready by default. You can find the `win32` directory in the platform subdirectory of your SDK installation.
You can then target `WIN` to compile the mod.io SDK for Windows SDK.

## Windows SDK Versions

The mod.io SDK is built and tested against Windows using Visual Studio 2019 & 2022. Using different versions of the Windows SDK may result in compilation issues.

In case you plan to use CMake to compile the mod.io SDK build outside of Visual Studio, you can take advantage of the default "CMake Extensions" typically found here:

```cmake
C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\Common7\IDE\CommonExtensions\Microsoft\CMake\CMake\bin
```

This folder, or a similar with respect to your installation, contain the relevant CMake binaries to start configuring with CMake. The CMake FlagTables file is located at C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\Common7\IDE\CommonExtensions\Microsoft\CMake\CMake\share\cmake-3.20\Templates\MSBuild\FlagTables` (or equivalent VS and CMake installation directory)
