# Getting Started

## mod.io MacOS SDK Integration

The use of MacOS with the mod.io SDK is ready by default. You can find the `macos`` directory in the platform subdirectory of your SDK installation.
You can then target `MACOS` to compile the mod.io SDK for MacOS SDK.

## MacOS SDK Versions

The mod.io SDK is built and tested against MacOS using XCode v14 & v15.1. Using different versions of the MacOS SDK may result in compilation issues.

In MacOS, the default way to compile the mod.io SDK requires CMake, which you can install following the https://cmake.org/download/[CMake webpage] instructions or using a package manager like `brew`:

```cmake
brew install cmake ninja
```

NOTE: You can use Ninja or XCode as project generators. The former works like any other C++ project. The later will create a `.xcodeproj` file in the designated output folder.
